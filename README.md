# makeup_tracker

I decided to create Makeup Tracker because I have way too much makeup (especially eye shadow). I always find myself lusting after makeup I don't own, and most of the time, I already own a product that looks and performs almost the exact same way (in the makeup world, we call that a "dupe").

This project has 3 main goals:

1) to get myself to STOP BUYING MAKEUP by showing myself that I probably already have a dupe in my collection
2) to make coming up with looks easier by seeing all the shades I own in one place (rather than displaying all my palettes and single shadows on my vanity--an impossible task, given the volume)
3) to keep track of the looks I do with the makeup I own
